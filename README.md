The repository contains Python and Mathematica codes used for theoretical analysis in "Sliding Multiferroics in Hexagonal Stacked CrI<sub>3</sub>". Each script has an associated README file that provides installation requirements, instructions for running the code, and expected outputs. 

Input files for the DFT calculations are included in the CrI3 folder. The same KPOINTS file is used for all calculations.
